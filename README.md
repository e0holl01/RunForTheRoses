# RunForTheRoses
This console app uses the list of running horses from the 2016 Kentucky Derby. The app provides a list of horses, asks for the user's name
and then prompts the user to pick a horse from the list. If the user picks a horse that is not on the list, the code goes in a loop until 
the user picks a horse from the list. Once the user picks the horse, the result of the horse's finishing position is displayed to the 
console and then written to a text file.
