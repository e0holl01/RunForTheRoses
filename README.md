# RunForTheRoses
This console app uses the list of running horses from the 2016 Kentucky Derby. The app provides a list of horses in random order, asks for the user's name and then prompts the user to pick a horse from the list. If the user picks a horse that is not on the list, the code goes in a loop until the user picks a horse from the list. Once the user picks the horse, the result of the horse's finishing position is displayed to the console and then written to a text file. 

To run the program, download the project files/open in visual studio. 
If you  add a breakpoint at approx. line # 139 where it says return derby results to see the list of horses(per the streaming video). 
you can confirm and  look at the list of horses and continue the program.
To confirm the file is written to text is correct and what is recalled correctly, the file HorseBet is in the bin/Debug folder.
